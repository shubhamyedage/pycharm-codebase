The\nsolvency of the company for the near future is described with the quick ratio which reflects if there are\nenough funds for normal execution of current transactions with creditors.

It means that {company_name} has {quick_ratio_yoy_chg_ind_3}\nassets which can be transferred to cash in a very short time to meet current liabilities.\nThe value of the third ratio, the cash ratio, is similar to the two previous ratios, lies in the {cash_ratio_yoy_chg_ind_1} range at the end of the period analyzed.
